## How It's Made
Helicopter Flight is built with JavaScript and HTML5 canvas.

While not necessarily realistic, the helicopter's motion is governed by equations for:
 - translation,
 - acceleration,
 - rotation,
 - pitch,
 - thrust,
 - gravity, and
 - ground contact friction
 
The flight controls are loosely inspired by lunar lander, where one can only pitch the craft and apply thrust, but using the mouse to calculate a desired pitch turned out to be an interesting challenge and allows for interseting flight.
